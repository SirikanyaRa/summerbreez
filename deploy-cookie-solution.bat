echo ðŸš€ Deploying CAPTCHA Cookie Solution to Railway
echo ================================================

echo.
echo âœ… Implementation Summary:
echo   - Enhanced CAPTCHA UI with cookie input
echo   - Backend cookie handling for user sessions  
echo   - Scraper prioritization of user cookies
echo   - Clear user instructions for cookie extraction

echo.
echo ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps:
echo   1. Adding all changes to git...
git add .

echo   2. Committing with descriptive message...
git commit -m "âœ… CAPTCHA Cookie Solution - Users can share browser cookies after solving CAPTCHA

Key Changes:
- Enhanced CAPTCHA UI with cookie input field and DevTools instructions
- Backend accepts userCookies parameter in /api/captcha-solved/:sessionId
- Scraper prioritizes user-provided cookies over fresh sessions
- Clear step-by-step workflow for cookie extraction
- Fallback strategies for different scenarios

This solves the core issue: backend now uses user's actual solved CAPTCHA session
instead of creating new sessions that might hit CAPTCHA again."

echo   3. Pushing to GitHub (triggers Railway auto-deploy)...
git push origin main

echo.
echo âœ… Deployment initiated! 
echo ðŸ”— Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
echo ðŸ§ª Test CAPTCHA workflow once deployed
echo.
echo ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist:
echo   â–¡ Navigate to deployed app
echo   â–¡ Start scraping process  
echo   â–¡ Wait for CAPTCHA detection
echo   â–¡ Follow cookie extraction instructions
echo   â–¡ Verify scraping continues with user cookies
echo   â–¡ Monitor success rates
echo.
echo ðŸŽ¯ This should resolve the CAPTCHA session sharing issue!
