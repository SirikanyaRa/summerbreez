# Data Extraction Issue - Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Malaysian postcode scraper is running successfully but returning empty data fields (all showing "-") instead of actual location and GPS information.

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the code review and testing, the issue appears to be related to:

1. **HTML Structure Changes**: The postcode.my website may have changed its HTML structure since the original working implementation
2. **CAPTCHA/Blocking Detection**: The enhanced CAPTCHA detection logic might be interfering with normal data extraction
3. **Selector Specificity**: The CSS selectors for data extraction may no longer match the current website structure

## Evidence
- Previous successful extraction exists in `pahang_15_details.json` showing the logic worked before
- Current scraper runs without errors but extracts no data
- User reports seeing all fields as "-" in the results table

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Logging in Extraction Function
- Added comprehensive console logging to `extractPostcodeData()` function
- Logs HTML content length, panel detection, table finding, and row processing
- Added debug information for troubleshooting empty results

### 2. Improved CAPTCHA Detection Logic
- Made CAPTCHA detection less aggressive to avoid false positives
- Now requires both CAPTCHA patterns AND absence of normal content
- Added better content indicators checking

### 3. Default Value Handling
- Added default "-" values for missing fields to ensure consistent output format
- This maintains UI compatibility while we debug the extraction

## Testing Strategy

### Diagnostic Scripts Created
1. `debug-extraction.js` - Tests extraction logic with real URLs
2. `test-endpoint.js` - Tests the API endpoint directly
3. `test-simple.js` - Simple extraction test without session management

### Next Steps for Resolution

1. **Run Diagnostic**: Execute the diagnostic script to see what HTML structure we're actually getting
2. **Compare Selectors**: Check if postcode.my has changed their HTML structure
3. **Update Selectors**: Modify the extraction logic if needed to match current structure
4. **Test with Small Dataset**: Use perlis_2.json (5 records) for quick testing

## Code Changes Made

### `script/scraper-service.js`
- Enhanced `extractPostcodeData()` with detailed logging
- Improved CAPTCHA detection logic to be less aggressive
- Added default value assignment for consistent output

### Test Files Created
- Multiple diagnostic scripts to isolate and identify the exact issue

## Expected Outcome
After running the diagnostic scripts, we should be able to:
1. Confirm if pages are being fetched successfully
2. Identify if the HTML structure has changed
3. Update the CSS selectors if needed
4. Restore full data extraction functionality

## Status
- ✅ Enhanced logging and error handling implemented
- ✅ CAPTCHA detection improved
- ✅ Diagnostic tools created
- ⏳ Pending: Run diagnostics to identify specific HTML structure changes
- ⏳ Pending: Update selectors based on findings
- ⏳ Pending: Full end-to-end testing with working data extraction
